REM Install create-react-app to global
npm install -g create-react-app
REM create-react-app {dir name}
create-react-app TempDir

...
Success! Created tempDir at C:\source\tempDir
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd tempDir
  npm start

Happy hacking!

//change to dir
cd tempDir

//start app
npm start

Compiled successfully!

The app is running at:

  http://localhost:3000/

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
